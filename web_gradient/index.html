          <p>Anyone using Instagram’s assets should only use the logos and screenshots found on our Brand Resources site and follow these guidelines. Only those planning to use Instagram’s assets in any broadcast, radio, out-of-home advertising or print larger than 8.5 x 11 inches (A4 size) need to request permission. Requests must be in English and include a mock of how you’re planning to use the Instagram logo.</p>
          <h2>Balance the Instagram Brand with your brand</h2>
          <p>Avoid representing the Instagram brand in a way that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Makes the Instagram brand the most distinctive or prominent feature.</li>
            <li>Implies partnership, sponsorship or endorsement.</li>
            <li>Puts the brand in a negative context as part of a script or storyline. You must comply with our Terms of Use and Community Guidelines.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <h2>Keep the word Instagram consistent</h2>
          <p>Keep the letter "I" in Instagram capitalized and in same font size and style as the content surrounding it. Don’t modify, abbreviate or translate the word Instagram to a different language or by using non-English characters, or use any of our logos to replace it. Don’t combine “Insta” or “gram” with your own brand. If you offer an app, website or a product or service that uses the Instagram APIs or is otherwise compatible with or related to Instagram, you may only use Instagram to say that your app is "for Instagram" or that the name of your campaign is "on Instagram" in a descriptive manner.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <h2>Distance Instagram from other social networks</h2>
          <p>Instagram may be mentioned in a television commercial with Facebook or other Facebook companies. Don’t mention other social networks in the same spot as Instagram and/or Facebook, unless it’s a general “Follow us on...” call to action. If you create a hashtag that uses the word Insta or gram, it shouldn't be used on other social networks and you shouldn't try to acquire or enforce rights over that hashtag.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <h2>Legal</h2>
          <p>Instagram’s trademarks, including Instagram, the Instagram logo, the Instagram glyph and app logos, InstaMeet, InstaStop, Insta, Gram, IG, Boomerang, IGTV and IGTV logo, Direct and Direct logo, the Instagram filter names, as well as the Hyperlapse logo, Layout logo and Boomerang logo, are all owned by Instagram and may only be used as provided in these guidelines or with Instagram’s permission. A list of some of Instagram’s trademarks can be found here. You may not use or register, or otherwise claim rights in any Instagram trademark, including as or as part of any trademark, service mark, company name, trade name, username or domain registration. You should not use or claim rights to "Insta" or "Gram" in a way that is confusingly similar to or dilutive of Instagram, including as, or as any part of, a trademark. Do not use Instagram’s trademarks for anything that would be inconsistent with Instagram’s terms or Community Guidelines. We may revoke permission to use Instagram’s trademarks at any time. Instagram reserves the right to withhold approval of content if it’s inconsistent with the Instagram brand.</p>
